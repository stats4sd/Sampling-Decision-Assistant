The essential features of a census are: a) Individual enumeration of persons as sampling units, b) all persons within a precisely defined territory (e.g. country or province) are enumerated, i.e. for a census it is not enough to enumerate a subset (sample) of the population, c) enumeration for all sampling units is simultaneous at a specified point in time, d) the census is repeated at scheduled regular intervals.

        { "Term": "cluster sampling", "Definition": "When the basic sampling unit in the population is to be found in groups or clusters, e.g. households beings in villages, the sampling is sometimes carried out by selecting a sample of clusters (e.g. villages) and observing all or a subset of the sampling units of each selected cluster. If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. \nThe clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required.Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).", "links": null, "slug": "cluster - sampling" },
