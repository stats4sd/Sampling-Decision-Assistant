  <h4>What indicators will guide your sampling decisions?</h4>
  <p>
    While most studies that use sampling intend to quantify multiple <glossary-link slug="indicator">indicators</glossary-link>,
    it is normal to base the decisions on a key
    indicator. In this section you will be asked to select such indicator and to establish the estimation requirements
    that
    will help you making sampling decisions later on.

    <p>
      The next question is about the estimate you are interested in. Many estimation processes are about estimating
      either of the
      following, please select the estimate that best describes your interest.
    </p>
    <survey-question controlName='q2.1.2'></survey-question>
  </div>
  <!-- case averages -->
  <div *ngIf="form.value['q2.1.2']=='Average or total value of indicator in the population'">
    <survey-question controlName='q2.2.1'></survey-question>
    <p>This value may be known from previous studies. You don’t need to be exact about this value, but the more exact
      you are,
      the better.</p>
    <div *ngIf="form.value['q2.2.1']=='Yes'">
      <!-- q2.2.2 needs ngif logic instead of question condition so that it displays in all cases on review and export
      (it's updated programatically in case no) -->
      <survey-question controlName='q2.2.2'></survey-question>
    </div>
    <div *ngIf="form.value['q2.2.1']=='No'">
      <p>If you don’t know the value and there is no information you can rely on, you may be able to come to an
        approximate
        value by answering the following questions</p>
      <survey-question controlName='q2.2.3'></survey-question>
      <survey-question controlName='q2.2.4'></survey-question>
      <p>If the distribution of the values of (indicator) in the population is roughly symmetric, this value would be
        an acceptable
        estimate. If the distribution is heavily skewed the value may be an overestimate and you may want to correct it
        slightly
        down. If the distribution is flat, that is the values do not cluster towards the mean, but low values and high
        values
        are as likely as values around the mean, this may be a slight underestimate.
