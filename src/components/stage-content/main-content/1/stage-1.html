  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>To design a sampling process, you should first have a clear idea of your main objective. This is, your overall aim
    for
    the activity that you are doing sampling for.</p>

  <p>
    Developing sampling designs is about making decisions that will define how you will collect data and how you will
    estimate
    the value of one or a set of characteristics of a population. We sometimes call those characteristics:
    <glossary-link slug="indicator">indicators</glossary-link>. This guide has been designed to help with this type of
    objective. This may happen for example
    when profiling populations, setting
    <glossary-link slug="baseline">baselines</glossary-link>
    or assessing the value of indicators at
    <glossary-link slug="endline">end-line</glossary-link> or midline points. Common examples can be seen in the
    <a href="/#//stage-1/resources">resources</a> tab.
  </p>

  <p>In some cases a study may be established to compare interventions and require a
    <glossary-link slug="quasi-experiments">quasi-experimental</glossary-link> or
    <glossary-link slug="experiments">experimental</glossary-link> approach. This tool has not been aimed to support
    decisions for this type of design, but
    it will provide pointers to resources and links that may help with the question of how many times a treatment
    should
    be repeated.</p>

  <!-- q1.1 -->
  <p>
    The first question you will answer broadly separates these two types of objectives. The first answer provided is
    for people
    conducting a survey to estimate a characteristic of a population. The second answer is for those wishing to
    evaluate
    the comparative benefits of a set of options while controlling external factors, that is, setting an experimental
    or
    a quasi-experimental study. If you are not sure which is the correct answer for you, have a look at the examples
    provided.

    <p>For the next question you will need to consider
      <glossary-link slug="representative-sample">representative</glossary-link> and
      <glossary-link slug="non-representative-sample">non-representative</glossary-link> samples. If you are not
      familiar with these terms then follow links to the glossary.

    <p>With your target population in mind, try to answer the following questions:</p>

  <survey-question controlName="q1.3"></survey-question>

  <note type="warning" *ngIf="form.value['q1.2']=='Non-representative'">
    <p>This tool does not provide support for sampling designs for non-representative samples. </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware about the issues
      of biases and the difficulties for making inferences from the sample to the general population, that emerge from
      studies
      that are based on non-representative samples. <br>
      A good introduction to when non-representative samples may be useful can
      be found in <br><i>“Research Methods in Anthropology: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches” </i> by Harvey
      Russell Bernard.
