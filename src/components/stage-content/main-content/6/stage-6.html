      <h4>Determining an overall sample size</h4>
      <p>
        Using the information provided it is possible to generate approximate sample sizes to guide the resource
        allocation process,
        based on determining the minimum number of households needed within a group to provide an estimate for an
        indicator to within a given margin of error. Formulae are provided to assess estimates as either the mean
        of a numeric indicator or the percentage of a categorical indicator, with the margin of error calculated
        from a confidence interval of a given level of confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This calculator assumes a clustered sample procedure will be taking place, and that random samples are able to
        be taken from
        within each cluster. If there is a simple random sample from the whole population is being taken, rather
        than a clustered sample, then set the design effect to be equal to “none”.
