    <h4>Decisions about selecting and reaching the sampling units</h4>
    <p>We will now find a method to select and reach the

        .</p>

        When selecting the sampling units, it is important to ensure they are selected at random. This means that every sampling
        unit in the target population should have the same chance to be selected into the final sample.</p>
    <p>
        The easiest way to do this so is to draw a simple random sample from a complete and up-to-date list of all sampling units
        in the target population. However, such a list often does not exist.</p>

    <p *ngIf="form && form.value['q5.1']=='No'">If a complete list does not exist, it is possible to group sampling units in a way that allows us to select some of these
        groups in a first step, and then select the final sampling units in each of the selected groups at random. This is
        called

    <p>It is much easier and quicker to find or build complete lists of sampling units in the selected groups only, as opposed
        to having to find or build a list of all sampling units in all groups. Furthermore, if the groups are small geographical
        units such as villages, it is possible to resort to area sampling methods which do not require lists at all (see
        <i>EPI-method</i> and
        <i>GPS sampling</i>).
