<h4>Sampling stages and frames</h4>
<p>The next step is to determine whether your sampling will be carried out over a single stage or multiple stages.</p>
<p>Consider the
    <glossary-link text="final sampling units" slug="sampling-units"></glossary-link>
    that make up your target population of
    <survey-reference controlName="q3.1"></survey-reference>.</p>
<survey-question controlName="q5.1"></survey-question>
<!-- q5.1 -->
<p *ngIf="form.value['q5.1']=='Yes'">As a final list does exist you have the choice to use it in a single stage sampling approach with
    <glossary-link text="simple random sampling" slug="simple-random-sampling"></glossary-link>, or you may still decide to use
    <glossary-link text="multiple stages" slug="multi-stage-sampling"></glossary-link>. Some of the pros and cons of each approach are discussed in the resources section.
</p>

<survey-question controlName="q5.1.1"></survey-question>
<!-- <note *ngIf="form.value['q5.1.1'] =='Single-stage'" type='dev'>Next steps for single stage to be completed, multi stage more indicative</note> -->

<p *ngIf="form.value['q5.1']=='No'">In this case you will need to use a
    <glossary-link text="multi-stage sampling" slug="multi-stage-sampling"></glossary-link>strategy. In order to do this you must first determine a set of sampling stages that will eventually
    narrow down to your final sampling units.
