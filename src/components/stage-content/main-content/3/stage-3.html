    <h4>Decisions about the target population</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="/#/step-by-step/stage-3/resources">Table 4 “Standard categories of analysis”</a> in the UNHCR Needs Assessment Handbook provides a useful description
        of criteria for the analytical framework of assessments. This framework is useful to specify the target population
        of the survey. In most cases, these populations are constructs that are determined by the objectives for which the
        study is being set up. Getting the boundaries of the population right, means that it would be possible to manage
        potential biases in the study.
        <br>
        <br> Use the following questions to describe the population of interest. We recommend that you look at standard categories
        of analysis presented in the UNHCR assessment handbook.

        <p>The next step is to identify any specific characteristics of those
            <survey-reference [controlName]="'q3.1'"></survey-reference> that can be used to define them as a group of interest and distinguish them from others.
            You should try to be as specific as you can, and consider the characteristics in the following ways:
