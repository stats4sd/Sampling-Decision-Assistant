    <!-- 0.8.2 -->
    <h2>0.9.0 (29th March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Quite a few changes have been implemented and will be continue to be refined throughout the day.
        <br>Please check back later today or tomorrow for and updated working version and notes
      </strong>

    </p>

    <!-- 0.8.2 -->
    <h2>0.8.2 (6th March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Navigation</strong> - Stages with multiple steps now have an additional bar at the top 
      to help navigate where in the process you the user is. The usual sliding style interaction between sections has also been replaced with a more subtle transition
    </p>
    <stage-breadcrumbs [stage]='5' [stageSlidesIndex]="1"></stage-breadcrumbs>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 4</strong> - Reporting levels are now classified during this stage (previously stage 5) and lists of combination
      are presented for review. In the future there may be an option for users to specify which levels of combination they
      consider relevant, however for now it should help to advise against the use of too many complex levels where not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tree diagram</strong> - now supports multiple reporting levels in a single stage and automatically populates combinations
      of unallocated reporting levels within the final sampling unit (orange boxes at the bottom level). It's also had a
      number of iterations of styling and display logic. (Next step will be to allow user input for nodes, an early template
      has been started in the resources -> allocating section however it's not functional yet)
    </p>

    <!-- 0.8.1 -->
    <h2>0.8.1 (3rd March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sample size calculator</strong> - A first pass have been given to write a calculator in R which is embedded into the
      app in stage 6. Currently the calculator requires the manual input of variables which are already present in the app,
      however in the future they will be better integrated.
    </p>
    <button ion-button icon-left (click)="launchSampleSizeCalculator()">
      <ion-icon name="calculator"></ion-icon>Sample Size Calculator</button>
    <p>
      <strong>Audio and Visual Resources</strong> - A new template has been included to display combinations of text, audio and visual
      resources, with a sample of resources available for stage 1, e.g.:
    </p>
    <div class="resources-demo">
      <resources [stage]="0"></resources>
    </div>
    <!-- 0.8.0 -->
    <h2>0.8.0 (27th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 5</strong> - The logic for the most complex case scenarios (e.g. multiple stages with sampling and stratification
      at each stage) is up and ready for wider testing. This required a rewrite of how much of the data was handled to better
      track nested and linked variables, and provide easier creation of custom question interfaces.
    </p>
    <ngx-image-viewer [src]="['assets/img/changelog/0.8.0-update-1.png']"></ngx-image-viewer>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 6</strong> - First draft of a sampling tree diagram is now available, linking to the data from stage 5. This
      will be built on in the upcoming updates to allow for allocation of sample sizes throughout all stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements (e.g. stage completion notifications for all stages, automatic saving after every
      cahnge, fewer double scroll bars, improvements for microsoft edge)
    </p>
    <!-- 0.7.2 -->
    <h2>0.7.2 (14th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 5</strong> - further development of multi-stage building strategy (incomplete)
      <br> Drag/drop interactions - currently implemented for stage 5 q5.2
      <br> Background saving and resume of unsaved project
      <br> Lots of minor bug fixes and style improvements as well as general improvements to backend project layout and logic
    </p>
    <!-- 0.7.1 -->
    <h2 id="th-february-2018">0.7.1 (9th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>Inclusion of a changelog (this page) to help provide more information on updates during development stages (it is also
      planned to include future roadmap)</p>
    <p>Stage 2 - now includes question on margins or error (2.4), questions related to proportions (2.1.2, 2.3.1), completion
      criteria, tweaks to text and interactions and resource key question placeholders.</p>
    <h2 id="th-february-2018-1">0.7.0 (6th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <ion-icon name="help-circle" style="margin-right:5px"></ion-icon>
      Help icons - now link to the resources section, and a couple of placeholder resources have been added to stage 1 to show
      how interactions might work. Resources are tagged to specific questions and open automatically when triggered from
      the help icon.</p>
    <p>
      Completion status - new checkbox at the end of a section to track completion status and allow marking a section as complete.
      Reflects in animated button at the top of the page as well as the main step-by-step dashboard/landing page. Currently
      implemented just for stage 1</p>
    <p>Stage 1 - Supporting text rewritten, minor changes to questions, expanded glossary</p>
    <h2 id="st-february-2018">0.6.2 (1st February 2018)</h2>
    <div id="mynetwork" class="tree-diagram" style="background-color: #DAE4E4;"></div>
    <p>Tree diagram visualisation component - integrated through the package vis.js, allows production of graphics such as tree
      diagrams and flow charts and will be used to help illustrate multi-stage sampling. Current placeholder illustrations
      available in sections 5 and 6</p>
    <h2>0.6.1 (22nd January 2018)</h2>
    <p>Further content development for stages 1-5, glossary restructuring</p>
    <h2>0.6.0 (20th January 2018)</h2>
    <p>Content development focused on stages 1 and 5. Warning/info messages and some codebase restructuring</p>
