    <!-- 0.9.. -->
    <h2>0.9.0 (29th March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>User Interface and Experience</strong>
      <br> Various improvements including ability to automatically resume last project, background saving on every change so
      work shouldn't be lost, clearer question boxes, and optional range-slider style question (currently bugged in chrome).
      <br>Option to rename reporting levels and sampling stages, and better managing of other data associated with them. A number
      of other minor bug fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Online Database</strong>
      <br> A backend development live database has been created and linked to allow content editors to directly make changes
      to the app (such as writing glossary definitions or resources). Once live this will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Structure and Logic Changes</strong>
      <br> A large rewrite of lots of the backend logic to better manage state changes. What this means in practice is:
      <br> a) The survey is now smart enough to not only manage what questions have/haven't been answered, but what is applicable/not.
      This should come in useful for the final export so there are not lots of unnecessary n/a values.
      <br> b) It's easier to understand exactly where in the app the user is - the url currently shows the general section, but
      not if the user is in the glossary, resources, or a subsection. Now it's easier to update selected portions of content
      based on this distinction, as well as do things like open a given set of resources after the help button has been clicked.
      <br> c) Finding and fixing bugs is easier as a timeline of all changes is generated and can be carefully observed.
      <br> d) Much improved efficiency on dynamic questions - e.g. automatically calculating standard deviation. Before we had
      to watch for changes to all question variables in the project as the specific min/max didn't yet exist. Now we can
      monitor the creation of new variables min/max and then attach an observer to respond when value changes
    </p>

    <!-- 0.8.2 -->
    <h2>0.8.2 (6th March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Navigation</strong> - Stages with multiple steps now have an additional bar at the top to help navigate where in the
      process you the user is. The usual sliding style interaction between sections has also been replaced with a more subtle
      transition
    </p>
    <stage-breadcrumbs [stage]='5' [stageSlidesIndex]="1"></stage-breadcrumbs>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 4</strong> - Reporting levels are now classified during this stage (previously stage 5) and lists of combination
      are presented for review. In the future there may be an option for users to specify which levels of combination they
      consider relevant, however for now it should help to advise against the use of too many complex levels where not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tree diagram</strong> - now supports multiple reporting levels in a single stage and automatically populates combinations
      of unallocated reporting levels within the final sampling unit (orange boxes at the bottom level). It's also had a
      number of iterations of styling and display logic. (Next step will be to allow user input for nodes, an early template
      has been started in the resources -> allocating section however it's not functional yet)
    </p>

    <!-- 0.8.1 -->
    <h2>0.8.1 (3rd March 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sample size calculator</strong> - A first pass have been given to write a calculator in R which is embedded into the
      app in stage 6. Currently the calculator requires the manual input of variables which are already present in the app,
      however in the future they will be better integrated.
    </p>
    <button ion-button icon-left (click)="launchSampleSizeCalculator()">
      <ion-icon name="calculator"></ion-icon>Sample Size Calculator</button>
    <p>
      <strong>Audio and Visual Resources</strong> - A new template has been included to display combinations of text, audio and visual
      resources, with a sample of resources available for stage 1, e.g.:
    </p>
    <div class="resources-demo">
      <resources [stage]="0"></resources>
    </div>
    <!-- 0.8.0 -->
    <h2>0.8.0 (27th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 5</strong> - The logic for the most complex case scenarios (e.g. multiple stages with sampling and stratification
      at each stage) is up and ready for wider testing. This required a rewrite of how much of the data was handled to better
      track nested and linked variables, and provide easier creation of custom question interfaces.
    </p>
    <ngx-image-viewer [src]="['assets/img/changelog/0.8.0-update-1.png']"></ngx-image-viewer>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 6</strong> - First draft of a sampling tree diagram is now available, linking to the data from stage 5. This
      will be built on in the upcoming updates to allow for allocation of sample sizes throughout all stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements (e.g. stage completion notifications for all stages, automatic saving after every
      cahnge, fewer double scroll bars, improvements for microsoft edge)
    </p>
    <!-- 0.7.2 -->
    <h2>0.7.2 (14th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stage 5</strong> - further development of multi-stage building strategy (incomplete)
      <br> Drag/drop interactions - currently implemented for stage 5 q5.2
      <br> Background saving and resume of unsaved project
      <br> Lots of minor bug fixes and style improvements as well as general improvements to backend project layout and logic
    </p>
    <!-- 0.7.1 -->
    <h2 id="th-february-2018">0.7.1 (9th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>Inclusion of a changelog (this page) to help provide more information on updates during development stages (it is also
      planned to include future roadmap)</p>
    <p>Stage 2 - now includes question on margins or error (2.4), questions related to proportions (2.1.2, 2.3.1), completion
      criteria, tweaks to text and interactions and resource key question placeholders.</p>
    <h2 id="th-february-2018-1">0.7.0 (6th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>
      <ion-icon name="help-circle" style="margin-right:5px"></ion-icon>
      Help icons - now link to the resources section, and a couple of placeholder resources have been added to stage 1 to show
      how interactions might work. Resources are tagged to specific questions and open automatically when triggered from
      the help icon.</p>
    <p>
      Completion status - new checkbox at the end of a section to track completion status and allow marking a section as complete.
      Reflects in animated button at the top of the page as well as the main step-by-step dashboard/landing page. Currently
      implemented just for stage 1</p>
    <p>Stage 1 - Supporting text rewritten, minor changes to questions, expanded glossary</p>
    <h2 id="st-february-2018">0.6.2 (1st February 2018)</h2>
    <div id="mynetwork" class="tree-diagram" style="background-color: #DAE4E4;"></div>
    <p>Tree diagram visualisation component - integrated through the package vis.js, allows production of graphics such as tree
      diagrams and flow charts and will be used to help illustrate multi-stage sampling. Current placeholder illustrations
      available in sections 5 and 6</p>
    <h2>0.6.1 (22nd January 2018)</h2>
    <p>Further content development for stages 1-5, glossary restructuring</p>
    <h2>0.6.0 (20th January 2018)</h2>
    <p>Content development focused on stages 1 and 5. Warning/info messages and some codebase restructuring</p>
  </div>
