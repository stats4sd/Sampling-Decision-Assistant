    <p>In this document find recorded the main changes that have been implemented.</p>

    <!-- 0.8.0 -->
    <h2>0.8.0 (27th February 2018)</h2>
    <p>Stage 5 - The logic for the most complex case scenarios (e.g. multiple stages with sampling and stratification at each
      stage) is up and ready for wider testing. This required a rewrite of how much of the data was handled to better track
      nested and linked variables, and provide easier creation of custom question interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stage 6 - First draft of a sampling tree diagram is now available, linking to the data from stage 5. This will be built on
      in the upcoming updates to allow for allocation of sample sizes throughout all stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements (e.g. stage completion notifications for all stages, automatic saving after every
      cahnge, fewer double scroll bars, improvements for microsoft edge)
