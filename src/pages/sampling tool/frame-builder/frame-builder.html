    <p>Stratification: Some explanation will be written about what it is with pointers to resources and the reasons why stratification
      is used (reporting and efficiency) create some space for the explanation. Remember that when using stratification the
      process of sampling is repeated independently within each stratum</p>

    If you are selected all the units at this stage, it is likely that the sampling units in the previous stage can be considered
    as clusters for the purpose of analysis. The Sampling Decision Assistant will include this in the summary of your sampling
    scheme. </p>
