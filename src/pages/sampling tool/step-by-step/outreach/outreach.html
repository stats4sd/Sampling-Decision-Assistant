            <h4>Decisions about selecting and reaching the sampling units</h4>
            <p>We will now find a method to select and reach the
              <span class="glossary-link" (click)="showGlossary('sampling-unit')">sampling units</span>.</p>
            <p>
              When selecting the sampling units, it is important to ensure they are selected at random. This means that every sampling
              unit in the target population should have the same chance to be selected into the final sample.</p>
            <p>
              The easiest way to do this so is to draw a simple random sample from a complete and up-to-date list of all sampling units
              in the target population. However, such a list often does not exist. If a complete list does not exist, it
              is possible to group sampling units in a way that allows us to select some of these groups in a first step,
              and then select the final sampling units in each of the selected groups at random. This is called
              <span
                class="glossary-link" (click)="showGlossary('multi-stage-sampling')">multi-stage sampling</span>.
            </p>
            <p>It is much easier and quicker to find or build complete lists of sampling units in the selected groups only,
              as opposed to having to find or build a list of all sampling units in all groups. Furthermore, if the groups
              are small geographical units such as villages, it is possible to resort to area sampling methods which do not
              require lists at all (see
              <i>EPI-method</i> and
              <i>GPS sampling</i>).
